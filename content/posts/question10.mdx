As someone who recently designed a support engineer interview at Bolt, I appreciated how this exercise focused heavily on real day-to-day tasks at Vercel. A support engineer's role is intriguing due to its blend of various responsibilities. The interview process for a support engineer can be challenging because it requires evaluating the candidate on both technical and soft skills. This exercise does an excellent job of assessing the candidate's skills, but there are a few areas where it could be improved:

- Instead of solely requesting the engineer to upload a Next.js project, it would be beneficial to invite them to an existing project and have them review the logs to identify why the build is failing. As a support engineer a lot of the time you are not starting from a clean slate, you are working with existing projects and trying to troubleshoot issues.

- While I understand the team's intention to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the candidates skills, I felt there were numerous questions in the exercise. This is great because you get a lot of information about the candidate, however I can see how this can become overwhelming for the hiring team to review. I would suggest reducing the number of questions to focus on the most critical aspects of the role.

- Although many questions focus on troubleshooting issues for customers, this represents only a portion of the tasks a support engineer handles. Including questions about new feature requests, handling enterprise customers, or exploring potential optimizations might provide a more comprehensive assessment.

- Vercel offers a diverse range of products, and as a support engineer, it's crucial to possess a well-rounded understanding and expertise across these products a company offers. While the exercise heavily focuses on Next.js, incorporating questions about other services such as TurboRepo, Databases, or V0 would be beneficial in understanding the candidate's breadth of knowledge and adaptability.
