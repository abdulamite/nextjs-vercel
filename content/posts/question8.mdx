## Response

Dear Valued Customer,

Thank you for contacting Vercel Support. I have reviewed your request and it looks like you have some questions regarding site indexing for search engines. 

If would not like your site to be indexed by search engines you can use a `x-robots-tag: noindex`. This is what Vercel does automatically for Preview deployments to prevent negative SEO impact from duplicate content. Here is a helpful guide with more information about this:
