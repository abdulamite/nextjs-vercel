## Context
Being on the outside, I cannot know for sure without looking at the ticket metrics, additionally, Vercels product lineup has grown substantially over the last few years. If I had to make the best guess as to what the most common problem is, I would think that it has to do with builds and deployments. I imagine it is customers a reaching out asking why their build is failing, or why their site is not being updated. 

## Solutions
Helping and assisting customers comes in multiphase approaches and this is something that I have learned from my time at my current job. It is important to be able to thing about the short term and long term implications of the issue to ensure that the customer is satisfied and but also that we are not constnatly working on the same issues.

### Short Term
 In the short term, customers need their issues resolved. If they are reaching out about an issue, this means they were not able to resolve the issue themselves with the resources available. We can work with the customer and help them resolve their issue. This might mean that we do some things manually but in the short term, it is important to understand that the customer is looking for a fix and we should respect their time and deliver a swift resolution. While we work on these issues we should try and understand why they felt like they needed to file a ticket to get support. 
### Long Term:
In the long term, we should be thinking about the root cause of the issue and if others are encountering the same issue. We should be asking questions such as:
- Is the common problem a result of a confusing UX?
- Did we not have documentation available to help the customer? 
- Is there a bug that needs to be resolved that causes us to get this question a lot?
- Is there a feature that we could add that would prevent this issue from happening in the future?
- Is there a way that we can automate the resolution of this issue so that customers do not have to reach out to us?
- Can we be more transparent about the issue through application logging so that customers can resolve the issue themselves?

At the end of the day, tickets are data points that give us the most raw look into the application experience and should be considered when thinking about the future of the application. Once we are able to identify the root cause of the issue, we can work on a solution that will prevent the issue from happening to the next customer. This might involve creating a new feature, updating documentation, or fixing a bug.
