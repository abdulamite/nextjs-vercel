If faced with a customer seeking help on an unfamiliar framework or technology, my troubleshooting approach would begin by requesting detailed information about the specific error messages or symptoms they're encountering, along with any recent changes made to their development environment or configuration. For instance, understanding whether the build was previously successful or if the issue arose after a recent update could provide valuable context.

Additionally, I would ask for the name of the project to access the build logs myself and review them firsthand. Throughout this process, my aim would be to discern whether the issue lies with the customer's build process or if it pertains to how the framework interacts with their setup, such as potential compatibility issues with Vercel.

To gain a foundational understanding of the framework or technology involved, I would research relevant documentation and resources. If needed I can also attempt to recreate the issue in an isolated environment to better comprehend the problem and test potential solutions without affecting the customer's production environment.

If I was unable to resolve the issue independently, I would seek assistance from colleagues who may have more familiarity with the technology or consult internal knowledge bases and previous conversations for insights.
