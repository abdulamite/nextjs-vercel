## Growth

One area of professional growth that I'm particularly passionate about delving into is the realm of leading support teams. Over time, I've discovered immense satisfaction in not only handling individual tickets but also in fostering a collaborative environment within the team. I've actively engaged in sharing my own experiences with handling tickets and have encouraged my colleagues to do the same.

For approximately a year now, I've taken the initiative to lead ticket review sessions, and it's been a remarkable journey witnessing the evolution of these sessions. What initially began as discussions centered around specific ticket inquiries has gradually transformed into deeper conversations touching upon various aspects of our application's behavior, the optimization of our processes, and refining our communication strategies with our valued merchants.

These sessions have become invaluable opportunities for the team to collectively analyze patterns, identify recurring issues, brainstorm innovative solutions, and continuously enhance our support practices. Furthermore, they've served as a platform for nurturing a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and growth within our support team.

As I continue to explore the realm of team leadership, I'm eager to further develop my skills in fostering a supportive and empowering environment, facilitating constructive discussions, and guiding my team towards achieving their fullest potential.
