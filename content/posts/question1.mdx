## Favorite Tasks
- Help train and onboard new support teammates - I love to help onboard and train my teammates because I think it is a great way to share knowledge and also learn from others while also cultivatig a culture of learning and growth. It is also a great way to build relationships with your team and foster a sense of community and let them know that they are not alone in their journey.
- Run Ticket Review sessions to ensure the tone is consistent - Ticket review sessions are something I currently own at Bolt and do 3 times a week. It is not only a great place to ask questions and ensure we are aligned in our communication, but also provides a space to check in and ensure that the workload is being distributed evenly and that no one is overwhelmed.
- Work with Engineering Teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders - I love to think of support engineering as a deeply collaborative workforce as by working cross-functionally, we can convey to engineers the needs of the customer and also provide a deeply technical overview of issues. Incidents specifically are interesting because they are a high-stress environment where you can learn a lot and also help to drive to a solution as a team. It may sound werid but I actially really love the rush of being pulled into an incident and being put on the spot to help solve a problem. Finally, it is such a great feeling to come back to the customer and let them know that their major issue has been resolved.
- Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project - This is something that I used to be really bad at but over time I have come to love diving into logs as they paint the picture of a user's journey. Crafting complex log queries and analyzing stack traces makes me feel like I am solving a mystery. 
- Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on the feedback of customers - As a support engineer, we interface with customers directly and get a lot of raw feedback from them. I love to take that feedback and work with the product team to develop new features that can help our customers because when this happens we eventually see this impact directly on the workload in a positive way.

## Least favorite  Tasks
- Help Resolve Billing Issues for Customers - These types of issues are never fun to deal with because if they come to you with a billing issue, chances are they are not happy.
- Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day - I think there is a part of this that is just the nature of the job, but I donâ€™t like to imagine it is just answering emails because it is so much more than that. Tickets can be a great way to learn about the product and the customer, and it can be deeply rewarding to help someone solve a problem. But when you are just answering emails, it can be difficult to see the bigger picture and can be a bit monotonous. Luckily as a support engineer the tasks to tend to vary a lot so it is not always just answering emails.
- Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and other 3rd party sites - I love interacting with developers on channels like a GitHub issues board, and Discord servers with content moderation. However for sites like Twitter and Reddit can have a lot of people who are not interested in a solution but just want to vent their frustration. At times it also can be difficult to foster a safe and inclusive community on these platforms.
- Write and maintain support articles and docs page - This one I do love to do, but it is difficult sometimes because the work is never really done. As applications scale, docs become outdated and constantly maintaining them can be a daunting task. This can be everything from API changes to UI updates, or entirely new features. 
- Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer. - I think when this works well, it is a wonderful thing where you can pair and understand an issue as a team, but when it does not work it can be difficult because sometimes I just want to see the whole picture and see the problem from a limited perspective can make it difficult to understand an issue and drive to a solution.
