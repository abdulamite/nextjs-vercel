> I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.


## Thought Process
At this point, the customer is in an escalated state and I would flag them as a churn risk to the Customer Success Manager to ensure that they are aware of the issue. If the customer is still onboarding, there is a chance that the customer would be looking for alternatives for their use case. 

There are many factors to consider when responding to this such as the history with the customer, whether they are an enterprise or a hobby customer. Generally, the most important part though is to be empathetic and assure them that I am working through a solution though I must have the information for their side to continue the investigation. One way to show the customer that I am working on the issue is to offer a call to work through the issue together as this creates an environment of collaboration and assures of my dedication to resolving the issue.

## Response
"Your frustration is completely understandable, and I'm here to collaborate with you to find a solution. To better assist you, I'd like to gain a clearer understanding of your setup. If you believe it would be beneficial, I'm more than willing to arrange a call where we can work through the issue together. After we've investigated thoroughly and identified any potential platform-related issues, I'll escalate the matter accordingly. Rest assured, your satisfaction remains my top priority, and I'm dedicated to resolving this situation promptly and efficiently.”
